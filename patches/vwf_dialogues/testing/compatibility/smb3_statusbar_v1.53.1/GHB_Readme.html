<h1>GHB's notes</h1>
This document illustrates the data format on how to edit SMB3 status bar RAM to be able to modify the status bar to add custom heads-up display (HUD) elements and
other things. Most of the counters included in this package can be moved or disabled in <kbd>smb3_status_defines.asm</kbd>. So far, this covers on how to edit tile
number (, properties) and palette. When patching <kbd>smb3_status.asm</kbd>, you should get something like this displayed on the Asar console window:

This is important, because if you wanted to edit tiles and other stuff without that, it can be difficult to locate what RAM to edit, not to mention, if you insert other patches,
you should keep track of RAM addresses reserved by other patches (they are often referred to as &ldquo;freeram&rdquo;) so you don't end up with two or more patches conflicting.
You can select and copy text from the console window (you may have to &ldquo;mark&rdquo; (rightclick the top title bar of the window &rightarrow; Edit &rightarrow; Mark and/or Copy))
and paste it in a <kbd>.txt</kbd> file for future references.<br><br>

I've provided instructions below and included javascript code that generates a table to find what data is associated to another. If you have edited the defines to relocate the RAM address,
make sure you enter the starting RAM address of the WHOLE thing, not any address in the sub-ranges marked with two dashes (&ldquo;--&rdquo;).
