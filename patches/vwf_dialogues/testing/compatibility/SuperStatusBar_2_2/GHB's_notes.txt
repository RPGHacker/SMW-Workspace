If the tab spacing looks ugly, open this in notepad++ and go to Settings -> Preferences -> Language, and set [Tab size]
to 8.

This is a tip made by GreenHammerBro to ASM-mers on how to use the Advanced super status bar (ASSB) with other codes/ASM.

1: The ASSB's RAM format and how to adopt codes to it
	SMW's status bar format is formated like this:
		$7E0EF9		;>Top row leftmost editable tile number
		$7E0EFA		;>Top row second leftmost editable tile number
		$7E0EFB		;>Top row third leftmost editable tile number
		...
	SMW's default tile properties and numbers are stored at ROM address
	$008C81 to $008CFE, yes, I said ROM address, meaning you cannot change
	the tile properties themselves in-game.

	The super status bar patch's data is formated like this:
		!RAM_BAR+0 ($7FA000/$404000 default)	;>Topmost and leftmost tile number
		!RAM_BAR+1 ($7FA001/$404001 default)	;>Same as above, but properties (YXPCCCTT)
		!RAM_BAR+2 ($7FA002/$404002 default)	;>Topmost, second leftmost tile
		!RAM_BAR+3 ($7FA003/$404003 default)	;>Same as above, but tile properties
		!RAM_BAR+4 ($7FA004/$404004 default)	;>Topmost, third leftmost tile
		!RAM_BAR+5 ($7FA005/$404005 default)	;>Same as above, but tile properties
		...					;>Will keep going rightwards and the next row downwards.

	check out [ASSB_map.png] and [RAM_BAR_MemoryLocater.html] for more information.
	
	-Please be aware that most ASM resources (patches and sprites, for example) still
	 uses SMW's vanilla status bar ($7E0EF9-$7E0F2F), you need to make it use ASSB's
	 ram and edit the way they write the tiles.
	 Here is an example of writing "123" on the status bar:
		-------------------------------------------------------
		!StatusBarLocation = $7FA000
		
		LDA #$01
		STA !StatusBarLocation
		LDA #$02
		STA !StatusBarLocation+1
		LDA #$03
		STA !StatusBarLocation+2
		-------------------------------------------------------
	That must be converted to this:
		-------------------------------------------------------
		!StatusBarLocation = $7FA000
		LDA #$01
		STA !StatusBarLocation
		LDA #$02
		STA !StatusBarLocation+2 ;>Multiply the displacement by 2 (2*2)
		LDA #$03
		STA !StatusBarLocation+4 ;>Multiply the displacement by 2 (4*2)
		-------------------------------------------------------
	Here is an example of a loop writing to the status bar (write "000"):
		-------------------------------------------------------
		!StatusBarLocation = $7FA000

		LDX #$03-1		;>loop 3 times, minus 1 (Indexes from 0 to 2)
		LDA #$00

		.Loop
		STA !StatusBarLocation,x	;>Write at [!StatusBarLocation, +1, +2]
		DEX
		BPL .Loop
		-------------------------------------------------------
	To be converted to this:
		-------------------------------------------------------
		!StatusBarLocation = $7FA000

		LDX #($03-1)*2		;>loop 3 times, minus 1 (Indexes from 0 to 2, now 0 to 4)
		LDA #$00

		.Loop
		STA !StatusBarLocation,x	;>Write at [!StatusBarLocation, +2, +4]
		DEX #2				;>Every loop, subtract X by 2 (Moves a full tile back, instead of a "half-tile")
		BPL .Loop
		-------------------------------------------------------
	If you are making hybrid compatibility codes that write to the status bar, I recommend using the
	define !StatusBarFormat and inform the user to set this to $01 or $02:
		$01 = SMW/SMB3/Minimalistic status bar patches. Each subsequent bytes is each tile.
		$02 = Super Status Bar/Overworld border plus patch.
	and have the code that writes (STA) also use the define:
		-------------------------------------------------------
		;Write "123"
		!StatusBarFormat = $02
		!StatusBarLocation = $7FA000
		
		LDA #$01
		STA !StatusBarLocation
		LDA #$02
		STA !StatusBarLocation+(1*!StatusBarFormat)
		LDA #$03
		STA !StatusBarLocation+(2*!StatusBarFormat)
		
		;!StatusBarLocation+(x*!StatusBarFormat) where x is what tile.
		-------------------------------------------------------
	And for loops (again, writes "000"):
		-------------------------------------------------------
		!StatusBarFormat = $02
		!StatusBarLocation = $7FA000

		LDX #($03-1)*!StatusBarFormat	;>loop 3 times, minus 1 (Indexes from 0 to 2, or 0 to 4 depending on the format)
		LDA #$00

		.Loop
		STA !StatusBarLocation,x	;>write at [!StatusBarLocation+0, +1, +2] or [!StatusBarLocation+0, +2, +4], depends on format.
		DEX #!StatusBarFormat		;>Every loop, subtract X by 1 or 2 (Always moves a full tile back), if X is FF or FE, end loop.
		BPL .Loop
		-------------------------------------------------------
	and now you're done. Of course, !StatusBarLocation can be at !RAM_BAR+x where X is the even number (so it
	writes to tile numbers and not properties).

	Another note is be aware on ORG-based patches that add hijacks smw's status bar code at a code at address
	$008E1A to $008FF9 for the purpose of adding new displays, just move their code to uberasm tool (call it
	in gamemode 14) and make them not hijack code potentially hijacked by this patch, since this is merely a
	heads-up-*DISPLAY*. For codes that move the counter around or disabling certain things, you have to disable
	or edit them *ON THIS PATCH*. A good example is the Metroid and SMB2 (titled
	"SMW Health Bar - Bugfix and Alternative") health patch. Mine however, have codes already based on uberasm
	tool and does not hijacks any of SMW's status bar code (most of them are already used the hybrid define).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2: Patches that does hex-edits tiles that are not controlled by a routine.

	This shouldn't be too hard, since most of it doesn't use indexed storing, for "hex edits" of the status
	bar, simply remove the block that has org $xxxxxx where x is around $008C81. For example from the metroid HP
	patch:

		org $8C89 ; Status bar rearangeing
			db $FC, $2C, $3E, $2C, $3E, $2C, $3E, $2C, $3E, $2C, $3E, $2C, $3E, $2C, $3E, $2C
			db $FC, $2C, $42, $38, $40, $38, $41, $38, $4A, $38, $FC, $38, $FC, $38, $4A, $78
			db $76, $38, $26, $38, $FC, $38, $27, $3C, $27, $3C, $27, $3C, $FC, $38, $2E, $3C
			db $26, $38, $FC, $38, $27, $38, $27, $38, $30, $38, $31, $38, $32, $38, $33, $38
			db $FC, $38, $FC, $38, $FC, $38, $FC, $38, $43, $38, $27, $38, $27, $38, $4A, $38
			db $FC, $38, $FC, $38, $4A, $78, $FC, $3C, $FC, $3C, $FC, $3C, $FC, $3C, $FC, $38
			db $FC, $38, $FC, $38, $FC, $38, $FC, $38, $FC, $38, $FC, $38

	^this is the hex edit to move the "constant" or "frozen" tiles of the status bar, remove that (or put
	semicolons ";" on the beginning of each line, including the [org $8C89 ; Status bar rearangeing]).

	Your new status bar tile editing is now in ASSB file, so edit the tables labeled "DATA_TILES:", and/or
	"DATA_TILESx:" where x is each data tiles or use the "Status Effect" tool in smwcentral.

	You might want to remove some other hijacks that controls the counters implemented into the HUD, because
	ASSB uses the hijacks that other HUD-effecting patches use also.

3: Other notes:

	-[fixed] There is something going on with the luigi's name on the ASSB, If you play as luigi and are in a
	 level, the last tile of the name, the letter "I" will glitch and show a top-half portion of the large
	 number 0 (that was used for the bonus stars counter). I check the tile properties table for that tile and
	 couldn't find why that is happening. If you found a fix for that, please PM me (GreenHammerBro) on smw
	 central, thanks. Edit: Thanks goes to DiscoTheBat for fixing that issue.
